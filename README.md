**This Flask web application provides a simple weather forecast service. Users can input a city name, and upon submitting the form, the app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The front end consists of two HTML pages: the index page with a form for city input, and the weather page displaying the retrieved weather information. The Flask backend handles requests, retrieves data from the API, and sends it to the frontend for dynamic display. The project showcases the integration of Flask, HTML templates, and external API calls to create a basic but functional weather forecast application.**
